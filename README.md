This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB related to conditional power calculations when the input is exactly zero. The function `myFunction` raises a number to a power based on a conditional statement. While it works correctly for positive inputs greater or less than 10, providing an input of 0 leads to a potential unexpected output.  The bug and its solution are detailed in the respective `.m` files.
